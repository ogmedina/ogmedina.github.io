              Oscar was born in San Antonio, TX and grew up in Laredo, TX.
              Growing up he had a interest in music, computers, and video games.
              He began learning how to play guitar at the age of 10 and then
              learned bass guitar at age 11 where he was in his first garage
              band with his school friends. He then joined the middle school
              band in eighth grade as a beginner and picked the french horn as
              his first band instrument. At United High School, he was enrolled
              in the Engineering & Technology Magnet where he had the
              opportunity to learn engineering fundamentals and be hands on with
              a variety of software and technology. After earning his high
              school diploma, he began working on his Bachelor of Music at Texas
              A&M University – Kingsville. While a horn and bass music student,
              he performed with the TAMUK Horn Choir, Q1 Horn Quartet, Jazz
              Band, Jazz Combos, and the TAMUK Percussion Studio. He has
              performed at venues and concert halls ranging from states in the
              U.S. including Texas, Alabama, Illinois, Colorado, to overseas in
              Germany and Switzerland.

              guitar and orchestra classes from 2010-2014. In 2014, he then
              began working for McAllen ISD at Morris MS as an Associate Band
              Director where he taught concert band, marching band, jazz band,
              and brass beginners. As an educator, his students were regular
              members of the TMEA Region XV Band/Orchestra, TMEA XV Jazz Bands,
              and were superior performers at UIL State Solo & Ensemble and UIL
              Concert & Sight-Reding contests. Outside of work, Oscar performed
              horn with the McAllen Wind Ensemble and bass guitar with the RGV
